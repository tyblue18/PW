# Free Domain Options for Your Portfolio

## Option 1: Customize Vercel Project Name (FREE & EASIEST)

Vercel gives you a free subdomain that you can customize:

### How to Change Your Vercel Project Name:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Click on your project** (currently probably named "PW" or similar)
3. **Go to Settings** → **General**
4. **Change the "Project Name"** to something like:
   - `tanishqsomani`
   - `tanishq`
   - `tanishq-portfolio`
   - `tanishq-dev`

5. **Your new URL will be**: `https://tanishqsomani.vercel.app` (or whatever you chose)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Completely FREE
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Professional enough for portfolios
- ✅ HTTPS included
- ✅ No DNS configuration needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still has `.vercel.app` at the end (not as clean as `.dev`)

## Option 2: Free Domain Providers (Not Recommended)

There are some free domain providers, but they have major downsides:

### Freenom (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf domains)
- **Free** but:
  - ❌ Often blocked by email providers
  - ❌ Not trusted by browsers/security tools
  - ❌ Looks unprofessional
  - ❌ Can be revoked
  - ❌ Poor for portfolios/resumes

### Subdomain Services
- Some services offer free subdomains like:
  - `yourname.freehosting.com`
  - `yourname.000webhost.com`
- ❌ Very unprofessional
- ❌ Not suitable for job applications

## Option 3: GitHub Pages (Limited)

GitHub Pages offers free hosting but:
- ❌ Doesn't work well with Next.js (needs static export)
- ❌ You'd lose dynamic features
- ❌ URL would be `yourusername.github.io` (not customizable)

## Option 4: Netlify (Similar to Vercel)

Netlify also offers free subdomains:
- `yourname.netlify.app`
- Similar to Vercel, but you'd need to migrate

## Recommendation: Use Vercel with Custom Project Name

**Best approach**: Change your Vercel project name to `tanishqsomani` or `tanishq` and use:
- `https://tanishqsomani.vercel.app`

This is:
- ✅ FREE
- ✅ Professional enough
- ✅ Easy to set up (5 minutes)
- ✅ Works perfectly with Next.js
- ✅ Many developers use `.vercel.app` domains

## When to Buy a Custom Domain

Consider buying `tanishq.dev` ($12-20/year) if:
- You want the most professional look
- You're applying to competitive positions
- You want something memorable
- You plan to use it long-term

But honestly, `tanishqsomani.vercel.app` is perfectly fine for most portfolios!
